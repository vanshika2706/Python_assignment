        "### **1. What is a RESTful API?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A **RESTful API** is an interface that allows different software applications to communicate over the internet using the **REST (Representational State Transfer)** principles. REST uses standard **HTTP methods** like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform actions on resources. These resources are usually represented as URLs, and the data is mostly sent and received in formats such as **JSON** or **XML**.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you have an online book store:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `GET /books` → will fetch the list of all available books.\n",
        "* `GET /books/10` → will fetch the book with ID 10.\n",
        "* `POST /books` → will add a new book to the store.\n",
        "* `PUT /books/10` → will update details of book ID 10.\n",
        "* `DELETE /books/10` → will remove that book.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason RESTful APIs are so popular is because they are **easy to use, scalable, and platform-independent**. Any device or application that can make HTTP requests (like browsers, mobile apps, or even IoT devices) can use them. This makes REST the most widely used style for APIs today.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Explain the concept of API specification.**\n",
        "\n",
        "An **API specification** is like a **rulebook or contract** that explains exactly how an API should be used. It tells developers what kind of requests can be made, what data should be sent, what responses will come back, and what error codes might appear. It prevents confusion between the team that creates the API and the team that uses it.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose there is a `POST /login` API. The specification will describe:\n",
        "\n",
        "* What input is needed → `{\"username\": \"abc\", \"password\": \"123\"}`\n",
        "* What output will be returned if successful → `{\"status\": \"success\", \"token\": \"xyz\"}`\n",
        "* What output will be returned if failed → `{\"status\": \"error\", \"message\": \"Invalid password\"}`\n",
        "\n",
        "A popular way of writing API specifications is **OpenAPI (Swagger)**. With it, you can generate automatic API documentation and test the API directly. API specifications save time, avoid errors, and make sure developers follow a consistent pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Flask** is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that is widely used for building web applications and APIs. Unlike larger frameworks such as Django, Flask gives developers the freedom to structure their code in their own way. It comes with the most essential tools, while additional features can be added through extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy (for databases) or Flask-RESTful (for APIs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Reasons Flask is popular for APIs:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Simplicity** → A Flask app can be built with just a few lines of code.\n",
        "2. **Flexibility** → No strict rules on how to design your project.\n",
        "3. **Large ecosystem** → Many extensions and libraries are available.\n",
        "4. **Quick to learn** → Easy for beginners but powerful for advanced users.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/')\n",
        "def home():\n",
        "    return \"Hello, Flask!\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Running this app starts a small server where visiting `/` shows \"Hello, Flask!\". This simplicity makes Flask perfect for **small to medium APIs**, prototypes, and learning projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. What is routing in Flask?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Routing** in Flask is the process of mapping URLs to specific functions in your code. Whenever a user visits a URL, Flask decides which function should run by checking the route definitions. Routes are created using the `@app.route()` decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "@app.route('/hello')\n",
        "def say_hello():\n",
        "    return \"Hello, User!\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, if you open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello`, Flask will call the `say_hello()` function and display \"Hello, User!\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Routing is essential because it allows you to handle different parts of your application. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `/login` → handle login requests.\n",
        "* `/profile` → display user profile.\n",
        "* `/products` → list products from the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask also allows **dynamic routes**. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "@app.route('/user/<name>')\n",
        "def user_profile(name):\n",
        "    return f\"Welcome {name}!\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "If you visit `/user/Vanshika`, it will show “Welcome Vanshika!”. This makes routing powerful and flexible for APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. How do you create a simple Flask application?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating a Flask application is very simple. You first install Flask using `pip install flask`, then write a small Python file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/')\n",
        "def home():\n",
        "    return \"Welcome to my first Flask app!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
        "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps explained:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Import Flask** and create an instance of it.\n",
        "2. **Define routes** using `@app.route()` to decide what each URL should do.\n",
        "3. **Create functions** that return text, JSON, or HTML as a response.\n",
        "4. **Run the app** with `app.run()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you start the app and open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, you will see the message \"Welcome to my first Flask app!\". From here, you can add more routes, connect databases, or return API responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "This shows how Flask makes it easy to start small but allows you to scale into bigger applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "In RESTful APIs, we use **HTTP methods** to tell the server what kind of action we want to perform on a resource. These are the most commonly used methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **GET** → Used to fetch data from the server.\n",
        "   Example: `GET /books` returns all books.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **POST** → Used to create a new resource on the server.\n",
        "   Example: `POST /books` with JSON `{ \"title\": \"New Book\" }` will add a new book.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **PUT** → Used to update an existing resource completely.\n",
        "   Example: `PUT /books/5` updates all details of book with ID 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **PATCH** → Similar to PUT, but updates only specific fields.\n",
        "   Example: `PATCH /books/5` updates only the title of book 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **DELETE** → Used to remove a resource from the server.\n",
        "   Example: `DELETE /books/5` deletes book 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods follow **CRUD operations**: Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT/PATCH), and Delete (DELETE). Using these standard methods makes APIs easy to understand and consistent across applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `@app.route()` decorator in Flask is used to connect a **URL path** to a specific Python function. When a user visits that URL, Flask runs the connected function and returns the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "@app.route('/hello')\n",
        "def hello():\n",

        "When you open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello`, it will run the `hello()` function and display \"Hello, Flask!\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The decorator also allows specifying **methods** like GET or POST:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "def submit():\n",
        "    return \"Form submitted!\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes `@app.route()` very powerful because you can decide what each URL should do and which HTTP method it should accept. In short, it is the **heart of routing in Flask applications**, without which you cannot connect your functions to web pages or API endpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Both **GET** and **POST** are HTTP methods, but they are used differently in APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **GET**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Used to **fetch data** from the server.\n",
        "  * Data is sent through the URL (query parameters).\n",
        "  * Example: `GET /search?name=book` → searches for \"book\".\n",
        "  * GET is visible in the URL and should not be used for sensitive data like passwords.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **POST**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Used to **send data to the server** (usually to create new resources).\n",
        "  * Data is sent in the **body of the request**, not in the URL.\n",
        "  * Example: `POST /login` with body `{ \"username\": \"abc\", \"password\": \"123\" }`.\n",
        "  * POST is more secure than GET for sensitive data.\n",

        "\n",
        "Errors happen often in APIs, such as when a user requests a missing page or provides wrong data. Flask provides several ways to handle errors:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Error handlers** → You can define custom responses for errors.\n",
        "\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This will return a JSON message instead of a plain HTML error page.\n",

        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "@app.route('/divide')\n",
        "def divide():\n",

        "* `POST /books` → adds a new book.\n",
        "\n",

        "### **15. What is the purpose of Flask’s jsonify() function?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `jsonify()` function in Flask is used to **convert Python data (like lists or dictionaries) into JSON format**, which is the standard format for APIs.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The `url_for()` function in Flask is used to **generate URLs dynamically** for routes in your application. Instead of hardcoding URLs in your code or HTML, you can use `url_for()` to create them. This is useful because if you later change a route, you don’t have to update it everywhere.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Static files like **CSS, JavaScript, and images** are important for websites. Flask serves these files from a folder called **“static”** by default. You just create a folder named `static` in your project and put your files there.\n",

        "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}\">\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask will automatically find the file from the static folder. For example, this would generate:\n",

        "```\n",
        "/static/style.css\n",
        "```\n",

        "\n",
        "An **API specification** is like a **blueprint or detailed instruction manual** for an API. It describes how the API should behave, what routes exist, what inputs are needed, and what outputs are returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you are building a login API, the specification might say:\n",

        "\n",
        "**HTTP status codes** are 3-digit numbers returned by the server that tell the client what happened with their request. They are very important in APIs because they help users understand whether a request was successful, failed, or needs fixing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some common status codes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **200 OK** → The request was successful.\n",

        "\n",
        "In Flask, a **POST request** is used when the client sends data to the server, usually to create a new resource. Flask handles POST requests using routes with `methods=['POST']`.\n",

        "3. **Statelessness** → Every request is independent; the server doesn’t remember past requests.\n",
        "4. **JSON/XML** → Data is usually exchanged in JSON for simplicity.\n",
