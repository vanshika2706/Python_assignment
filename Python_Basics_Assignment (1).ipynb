        "**Question 2 :- What is an interpreter in Python  **\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer :- An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and runs your Python code line by line , instead of converting the whole code into machine language at once like a compiler does. When you write a Python program and run it, the interpreter checks each line, translates it into something the computer understands, and then executes it immediately. This makes it easier to spot and fix errors, because you will know right away which line caused the problem. Python uses an interpreter by default, which is why its great for beginners it lets you test your code quickly without long wait times .\n"

        "**Question 3 :- What are pre-defined keywords in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer :- Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that have a fixed meaning in the language. You cannot use them as variable names or function names because Python uses them to understand the structure and logic of your code. These keywords are already defined by Python, and they help in writing commands like loops, conditions, functions, and more. For example, words like if, else, for, while, def, return, and class are all keywords. If you try to use a keyword as a variable name, Python will show an error. There are more than 35 keywords in python  and they are always written in lowercase except True, False, and None. Keywords make your program understandable to the Python interpreter."

        "\n",
        "Answer :- No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Keywords are special words that Python has already reserved to perform specific tasks in a program. For example, words like if, while, for, def, and return are used to define conditions, loops, and functions. These words have a fixed meaning, so if you try to use them as variable names, Python will show an error. For example writing if = 10 will cause a syntax error because if is used to start a condition, not to store a value .  To avoid such problems, you should always choose different names for your variables that do not match any keyword."

        "\n",
        "Answer :- Mutability in Python means whether or not a value can be changed after it is created. If a data type is mutable, it means you can change its content without changing its memory address. For example, lists and dictionaries are mutable you can add, remove, or change items in them."

        "Question 6 :- Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer :- In Python, lists are mutable because they are designed to store collections of items that may need to change. You can add, remove, or update elements in a list after it is created. This is useful when you need a flexible data structure that can grow or shrink as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        " Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their contents cannot be changed. This design helps keep the data safe and unchangeable, especially when you want to store values that should stay constant throughout the program. Tuples are also faster and use less memory than lists, which makes them better for situations where performance matters and no changes are required. Python makes this difference to give you options: use lists when you need to modify data and tuples when you need fixed, secure data. This also helps prevent accidental changes in your program .\n"

        "Answer :- In Python, '==' and 'is' are two different operators, and they are used for different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        " The '==' operator checks whether two values are equal. It compares the data or content of the variables. For example, if a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [1, 2, 3] , then a == b will be True because the lists have the same values.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the 'is' operator checks whether two variables refer to the same object in memory. So, in the same example, a is b will be False because even though the values are the same, they are two different objects stored in different memory locations. If you do a = b, then a is b will return True because now both point to the same object.\n",

        "\n",
        " They combine two or more expressions and return either True or False based on the logic. The three main logical operators in Python are and, or, and not.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        " For example, if x = 5 and x > 2 and x < 10, the result is True because both parts are true. If even one condition is false, and gives False.\n",

        "* The 'or' operator returns True if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "  For example, x > 2 or x < 3 will be True if any one of them is true. It only gives False when all conditions are false.\n",

        "\n",
        "For example, if you have a number stored as a string like \"10\" and you want to add it to another number, you must first convert the string into an integer using type casting.\n",
        "\n",
        " In Python, you can use functions like int(), float(), and str() to change data types. For example, int(\"10\") will turn the string \"10\" into the number 10, and str(5) will turn the number 5 into the string \"5\".\n",
        "\n",
        "This is helpful when taking user input which is usually in string form and using it in calculations. Type casting makes your program more flexible and avoids errors that happen when trying to mix different data types in operations."

        "Answer :- Type casting in Python is of two types: implicit and explicit. The difference between them is who performs the conversion Python or the programmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In implicit type casting, Python automatically converts one data type to another when needed, without the programmer writing any extra code.\n",
        "\n",
        " For example, if you add an integer and a float like 5 + 2.5, Python automatically converts the integer 5 into a float and gives the result 7.5. This is safe and simple because Python handles it on its own.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In explicit type casting, the programmer manually converts one data type into another using functions like int(), float(), or str().\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer :- The elif statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions after an if statement. It stands for “else if”. When you have more than one condition to test, instead of writing many if and else blocks, you can use elif to make your code cleaner and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "-> The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to run the loop. It is commonly used to go through items in a list, string, or range of numbers.\n",
